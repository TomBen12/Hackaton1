This game simulates a day at Developer Institute, where the player is a student trying to balance determination, stress, and knowledge to pass the final quiz at the end of the day.

The player starts with:
	•	Determination: 100
	•	Stress Level: 0
	•	Knowledge Level: 0
	•	The goal is to answer coding-related questions to gain knowledge while managing stress and determination.
	•	The player chooses quizzes (Easy/Medium/Skip).
	•	Final Quiz: make the quizz harder depending on your knowledge.
	•	Strategy: Skipping too many quizzes, failing too many questions or making choices when faced with events will impact your knowledge and stress and then, how hard the final test will be.

Determination (100 → 0)	Decreases with stress & wrong answers
Stress Level (0 → 100) Increases/Decreases depending on choices of answers and actions
Knowledge Level (0 → 100)	Increases with correct answers, affects final quiz.

	•	Easy Quiz → Low reward, low risk.
	•	Medium Quiz → Higher reward, but higher stress if failed.
	•	Skip Quiz → No stress increase, but you lose learning opportunities.

	•	If knowledge is too low, the test becomes extremely difficult.
	•	If determination hits 100, you fail the day and must restart.
    •	If determination hits 0, you fail the day and must restart.
