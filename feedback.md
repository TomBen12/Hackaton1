Tom, 
Your Hackathon project is really great! I really love the idea and the final result.
You used all the topics and tools we learned in class, and you werenâ€™t afraid to try new things.
Your code is readable, super clean, and well-structured, with different files, classes, and functions.
You also did a great job creating a good user interface and ensuring your code is not repetitive.
You did an excellent job!
